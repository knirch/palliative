Mostly shell related palliative whatchamacallits

## go-where-you-were

Keeps track of what the last dir that was entered and jumps to that directory
when a new shell is started. This came from my normal frustration of having to
navigate to the current directory when I needed an auxilliary shell to work in.

## jump-to-active-dir

Similar in fashion to `go-where-you-were` this adds a quick jump via fzf to any
working directory for all bash processes or instances of vim.

## autojump-fzf

Simple function to use [autojump](https://github.com/wting/autojump.git) with
[fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf).
